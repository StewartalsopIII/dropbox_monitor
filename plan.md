# Audio File Chunking Implementation Plan

## Objective
Add support for processing large audio files by implementing intelligent file chunking that maintains audio quality and context.

## Task 1: Create AudioChunker Class
**Purpose**: Split large audio files into processable chunks
**Steps**:
1. Create new audio_chunker.py file
2. Implement size checking
3. Add ffmpeg-based splitting at silence points
4. Create temporary chunk management

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Successfully splits files over 15MB
- [ ] Chunks maintain audio quality
- [ ] Splits occur at natural silence points
- [ ] Temporary files cleaned up properly

## Task 2: Update Transcription Handler
**Purpose**: Integrate chunking with existing transcription system
**Steps**:
1. Add chunking support to process_audio_file()
2. Implement chunk transcription handling
3. Add transcript reassembly
4. Update progress logging

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Detects when chunking is needed
- [ ] Processes all chunks successfully
- [ ] Reassembles transcripts correctly
- [ ] Maintains existing functionality

## Testing Plan
1. Test with various file sizes:
   - 10MB file (no chunking needed)
   - 25MB file (2 chunks)
   - 50MB file (4+ chunks)
2. Test with different audio formats:
   - WAV files
   - MP3 files
   - M4A files
3. Verify handling of:
   - Continuous speech
   - Natural pauses
   - Multiple speakers

## Success Metrics
1. Can process files of any size
2. No loss in transcription quality
3. Clean handling of temporary files
4. Accurate progress reporting

## Implementation Notes
- Keep chunk size under 15MB to stay safely under 20MB limit
- Use ffmpeg silence detection for natural break points
- Maintain original file timestamps
- Preserve all metadata

## Next Steps
1. Implement AudioChunker class
2. Test chunking in isolation
3. Integrate with TranscriptionHandler
4. Add comprehensive error handling
